This is the README file for the github of the mems project. The usage of the code is pretty straightforward. Almost all calculations are done in python files, except the Eigen_Frequency.mlx file, which makes a nice bodeplot in Matlab. The other files used in the final design are flectures_torsion.py, which discribes the spring constant of the torsional springs, Quick_and_Dirty, which calculates the force produced, by getting the overlapping area from Overlap.py. The other files contain calculations on earlier iterations, but were not used in the final design and will also not be commented on further here. Oscillator.py was used to find the oscillation of the micro mirror when a moment is applied.
